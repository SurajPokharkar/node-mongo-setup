# node-mongo-setup
Configuring Nodejs and Mongodb

Prerequisites:

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

1]A GitHub account
2]A GitHub repository for your Node.js project
3]Basic knowledge of Node.js and MongoDB


Steps:

1]Open your GitHub repository and click the "Code" button.
2]Click "New Codespace" to create a new Codespace for your project.
3]Choose a template that includes Node.js and MongoDB, or create a custom environment that includes these tools.
4]Once your Codespace is ready, open the terminal and install any additional packages or dependencies that you need using the npm install command.
5]To set up MongoDB, create a new database and collection using the MongoDB command-line interface. You can then connect to your MongoDB instance using a Node.js driver such as Mongoose, which allows you to interact with your MongoDB database from your Node.js application.
6]Create a new Node.js application using the Express framework.
7]Configure your Node.js application to connect to your MongoDB database using Mongoose.
8]Write code to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on your MongoDB database.
9]Test your Node.js application by running it in the Codespace environment.


Conclusion:

Setting up Node.js and MongoDB on GitHub Codespaces is a straightforward process that can help you streamline your Node.js development workflow. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can quickly and easily set up a fully functional development environment that allows you to create, test, and deploy Node.js applications using MongoDB as a data store.

I hope this README.md file helps you get started with setting up Node.js and MongoDB on GitHub Codespaces! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
